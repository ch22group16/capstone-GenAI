We have used the dataset from Github AESLC.

The dataset is annotated Enron Subject Line Corpus. It has dev, test, and train email datasets.

Cleaned, filtered, and deduplicated emails from the Enron Email Corpus.
Sizes of train/dev/test splits: 14,436 / 1,960 / 1,906
Average email length: 75 words
Average subject length: 4 words

Some of our notebooks use a combined loader so we have four files 
These three are individiual datasets
1. dev.zip
2. train.zip
3. test.zip

The combined folders are present in the master.zip file
